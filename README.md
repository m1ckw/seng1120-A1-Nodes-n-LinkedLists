SENG1120 is a Data Structures course run by the University of Newcastle. 

Assignment Scope:   Build the infrastructure to manipulate data related to trains transporting coal. 
                    Create a Linked List class to store the trains information within nodes in the list.
                    You will also need to create a Node class. The Linked List will store the trains ID, 
                    time of arrival, and weight from the Train class provided. 

Requirements:       The linked list must be a doubly linked list.
                    The linked list will use instances of Node to store instances of Train. 
                    The linked list class will be used by the main program "LinkedListDemo" which is supplied.
                    The Linked List and Node classes must be designed in a way to comunicate seemlessly with main program.
